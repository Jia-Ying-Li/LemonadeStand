  This is a simulator that allows the players to set up their own shop and sell lemonade. The players can buy and adjust the ratios of ingredients to make the perfect drink. Given a certain amount of money to start off ($30), over a 10-day period, the user must sell as much lemonade as possible to maximize profit.
